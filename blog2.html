            <h1>Is AI Good or Bad?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I would say that AI (artificial intelligence) is technology that I would be better off without – but it’s a necessary part of life. AI is here to stay. <br><br>

                It helps us to complete tasks much faster and more efficiently. Yes, AI will replace tasks and possibly jobs. This week, a friend was asked at her job to use AI to speed up her workflow. She will be able to finish her tasks at three times the speed if she asks AI to do the work for her. Is there an ethics question there somewhere? Probably. Are we encouraging AI to replace certain jobs? Maybe. But do we have a choice? If my friend makes a stand and says, “No AI for me!” she could be job hunting tomorrow. <br><br>
                
                Out of curiosity, I asked AI to write a paragraph about the benefits of AI, and it replied, “Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a necessary part of life in the modern world due to its transformative potential across various sectors. AI-powered systems enhance efficiency and productivity by automating tasks, analyzing vast amounts of data, and providing valuable insights in fields like healthcare, finance, and transportation. From personalized medicine and medical diagnosis to fraud detection and risk management, AI improves decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, AI enhances user experiences through virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and customized content, making technology more intuitive and accessible. As AI continues to evolve, its ability to address complex challenges and drive innovation makes it an indispensable tool for progress and improvement in various aspects of life.” <br><br>
                
                This paragraph was generated in one second. I can’t type that fast, let alone think that fast. In the future, our skills won’t be about how well we think creatively but how well we are able to use AI to do our work. <br><br>
                
                It is clear that even if some of us push as hard as we can against the progress of AI, others will pull equally as hard to advance AI so we can incorporate it more into our daily lives and our jobs. In the future, AI will be as commonplace as mobile phones. Those who can use AI will reap the most benefit. What do you think?</p>
