    <h1>the year of adventures</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>I’m so happy to look back at my year, in retrospect it looks really good. So far we have lived for 2 years in Oregon and are still in love. Over the past year we have explored more of Washington State, experienced more Oregon and even got a bit of Northern California fix. It’s really amazing how different life is on the west coast. I love the culture and people here as they value their free time more than anything. People pretty much go to work to fund their hobbies and obsessions, it’s not exactly as bad as it may sound. To tell the truth, I’m one of those people. <br><br>I love nature, I adore the ocean, I admire art. What else do people worship here? Art and music scene is probably the best I’ve seen so far, lots of free options as well as the expensive ones if you prefer those. I love the theaters and live music venues, in this city I feel that I can afford it all.

 <br><br>Seattle is a blast, the art museum and the waterfront tourist fun. Olympic National Park is the right wonder of the world, not true but close enough. mt Rainier camping at La Vis Vis was really amazing. Trillium lake in Oregon showing off Mt Hood in all its beauty was pretty cool. Paradise Creek camping in Washington is predictably awesome. Succor Creek in Oregon once again is the place to go and camp, hidden gem. <br><br>

 Mt Angel is the German town worth checking out. Oktoberfest is the biggest event of the year. Memaloose hiking in spring makes you find yourself in a different universe. Rhododendron garden in Portland is a seasonal treat for the locals and visitors. Astoria is the city on the coast, check it out with or without a reason, always a celebration, always a surprise. Going to Springfield where the Simpsons were created is a surreal coincidence I didn’t plan or expect. Totally worth checking out as well as Eugene which is right next door. <br><br>    </p>
