    <h1>Nothing Really…</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>I love crafting poems. While they might not be Shakespearean masterpieces, they capture moments and emotions in a way that’s meaningful to me. Whether it’s a heartfelt sonnet or a playful rhyme, poetry is my way of expressing myself. Some days I’m dark—some days I’m light. What can I say I’m an enigma. <br><br>Designing images and logos is something I enjoy and do reasonably well. I like creating visuals that are eye-catching and functional, and it’s rewarding to see my ideas come to life in digital form. And yes, I do let AI make my “girls” look good because why would I want to make them ugly?  <br><br>I genuinely care about the people in my life. Whether it’s lending an ear, offering support, or just being there, I try my best to show up for those I care about. It’s important to me to build and maintain strong, meaningful relationships. I tend to get used and discarded, but at least I tried. <br><br>Lastly, I don’t take myself too seriously and can laugh at my own mistakes and mishaps. It’s a healthy way to deal with life’s little (or big) bumps and makes everything a bit more manageable until I start laugh—crying and just wind up looking insane and like the men in little white coats need to come collect my little ass. <br><br></p>
