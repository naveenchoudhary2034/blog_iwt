    <h1>… I left my heart in Barcelona</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>I’ve never participated in this “Daily Writing Prompt” before, but today’s topic caught my eye and the creative juices started to flow!
        So let’s see…<br><br>
        – Do you have a favorite place you have visited? Where is it?<br><br>
        Well, for me it’s definitely Barcelona.<br><br>
        
        Where do I even begin this story? It was February 2019 – I was in England and in a desperate need of some faraway place and a recharge. I remember searching the Skyscanner deals: from Manchester – to Anywhere, yeah this was my criteria… Anywhere. That’s how I took a veeery spontaneous trip to Barcelona.<br><br>
        From the moment I set foot in this vibrant place, I felt an undeniable connection. The sun was shining, and the city was buzzing with life – a bit different than the winters in England.<br><br>
        As I wandered through the charming streets and spent lazy afternoons soaking up the sun and watching the waves crash against the shore, I felt a sense of joy that I hadn’t experienced in ages.<br><br>
        I’ve visited many countries before, and other cities in Spain too, but only here I felt like hahhh, this is something different… I could actually live here. Barcelona was more than a city – it felt like a home. The blend of culture, history, and that laid-back Mediterranean vibe made it easy to fall head over heels.<br><br>
        It captured my heart and left me longing for more. <br><br>
        
        After this first visit, I couldn’t help but keep coming back, making a trip every year. It was like I was in a long-distance relationship with Barcelona, and I knew deep down that I wanted more and more.<br><br>
        Finally, in March 2024 I made the leap that changed everything: I moved to Barcelona, and let me tell you, it has been the best decision of my life! It’s been nearly 10 months since I’ve settled here, and every single day feels like a dream come true.<br><br> 
        So, if you’re considering a big change or a new adventure, just go for it! You never know what amazing experiences await you.<br><br>
        Cheers to new beginnings!</p>
